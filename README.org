* Global philosophy
The idea is to provide tools and the accurate process to train a statistical voice based on the HTS
framework.
* Architecture
* Process
If you want to run the full process, the only thing you have to do is running this loop after
setting the CONFIGURATION variable:
#+begin_src sh
  CONFIGURATION=<the basename>
  for i in `ls -d [0-9]*`
  do
      (cd $i; ./gradlew -Deval_name=$CONFIGURATION publish)
  done
#+end_src
* COMMENT some extra configuration
